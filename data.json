A number of important inventions are attributed to them which are now part of the human patrimony. We can namely mention geometry, theoretical mathematics, logic, grammar, rhetoric, philosophy, physics, biology, scientific astronomy (based on mathematics), the theatre and the Olympic Games.</p> <p class='text-paragraph'>They have also invented a model of education that takes form mainly in the teaching of philosophy and in the philosophical schools of the antiquity. In fact, philosophers invented the first schools in Athens where small groups of learners studied. These schools were designed not for children, but rather for adolescents and adults. Philosophers are thus the ancestors of university teachers.</p> <p class='text-paragraph'>Somehow, they invented the first universities, the first public places entirely designed for study and the search for Truth. They are rightly considered as the founding fathers of the occidental educational history. Their objective was not to teach a particular type of human being as was the case in the other civilizations of that time, but rather to form the <span class='text-highlight'>complete human being</span>, both spiritually and mentally. They aimed at developing in him the critical sense, reason and emotion, the capacity to think and to have superior feelings.</p> <p class='text-paragraph'>In what follows, we shall examine some conceptions suggested by thinkers—essentially philosophers—of the antiquity concerning education, training, culture and other dimensions related to the field of education. We shall consider the conceptions put forward by the sophists, Socrates and Plato. These are philosophical, theoretical and abstract conceptions which are not directly applied to pedagogy as we conceive of it in our modern schools. These conceptions are rather related to the philosophical foundations of education in general.</p> <h3 class='content-h3-decorated'>The Problem of Plurality</h3> <p class='text-paragraph'>In education, the Greeks knew the problem of the plurality of education which was the result of their political system (democracy and the role of thinking and rational discussion) as well as the discovery of other cultures. There were simultaneously two types of education in Greece:</p> <div class='data-table-wrapper'> <table class='data-table'> <thead> <tr> <th>Traditional Education</th> <th>New Education</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Military and Aristocratic</td> <td>Philosophical and Mystic</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Took place within the family</td> <td>Sophisticated and organized</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Inspired by poetry models of virtue</td> <td>Based on science and democracy</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <p class='text-paragraph'>In the 5th Century B.C. traditional education was seriously questioned. Due to the culture crisis, the appearance of writing, the development of sciences and philosophy and democracy, the old traditional education did not work anymore. This situation of conflict led the Greeks to search for new forms of education. In fact, they turned towards 'new philosophers' (religious people, wise men, sophists) to provide them with new education for adolescents (only boys).</p> <div class='callout-box'> <span class='callout-quote'>'There are many forms of education, which is the best? Which one to choose?'</span> <small class='callout-attribution'>— The Greek Educational Dilemma</small> </div> <p class='text-paragraph'>This problem is not related to how to educate but to <span class='text-highlight'>why to educate</span>, i.e., to the objectives. The Greeks had to think of the objectives of education. This problem implied an important political dimension because education does not only aim at training individuals, but also responsible citizens inside the community. This critical situation can be illustrated by the Sophists and Socrates.</p> </div> </div>"

The Sophists</h2> <p class='text-paragraph'>A sophist is somebody who knows or a wise man, or as we would say nowadays a cultivated man. Sophists are men of high culture and knowledge, distinguished by their power of spirit and words. They were mostly foreigners or travelers who moved from one town to another to sell their talent. They can be defined as the <span class='text-highlight'>masters of discourse</span>, masters of 'know how to speak' in public, of 'know how to convince'.</p> <p class='text-paragraph'>They suggested to their pupils to learn to express themselves so as to be able to talk in all circumstances. They considered language not as a means of knowledge but as a means of control and action towards the others, or a tool of persuasion. The sophists are the inventors of rhetoric and eloquence that played a major role afterwards since the art of speaking well remained till the 20th Century a sign of a good education and high culture.</p> <h3 class='content-h3-decorated'>The Literary Culture</h3> <p class='text-paragraph'>They are the creators of what is called 'literary culture' or the 'great culture' based on the idea that knowledge is not only a content of truth, but also a <span class='text-highlight'>form of beauty</span>. So, it is not sufficient to tell the Truth, but it has to be nicely said. Their vision of education is deeply determined by politics, or democracy, which requires a general competence on the part of all citizens: being able to express themselves in public in a coherent way so as to convince the others of the value of their opinion.</p> <h3 class='content-h3-decorated'>Professionalization of Teaching</h3> <p class='text-paragraph'>The sophists are considered as the first teachers. With them, education was no more a family enterprise managed by the daily social milieu. The sophistic education was:</p> <ul class='list-standard'> <li class='list-item'><strong>Organized:</strong> It consciously wanted to achieve a goal.</li> <li class='list-item'><strong>Individual:</strong> It was not collective, but focused on the pupil.</li> <li class='list-item'><strong>Professional:</strong> The teacher offered services for pay; pupils had to leave their homes to study.</li> <li class='list-item'><strong>Theoretical:</strong> They valued general culture and abstract notions over specialized craftsmanship.</li> </ul> <p class='text-paragraph'>The sophists did no teach a specialized knowledge, but a general culture, i.e., how to think, how to live and how to speak. They were not craftsmen or specialized technicians but exclusively teachers.</p> </div> </div>"

Who is Socrates?</h2> <p class='text-paragraph'>Socrates (c. 469 BC – 399 BC) was a renowned Greek teacher who preferred conversational teaching and left no written records. Our knowledge of his teachings comes primarily from his students, such as Plato. Socrates believed that <span class='text-highlight'>wisdom begins in admitting your own ignorance</span> and that self-knowledge is the ultimate virtue.</p> <div class='callout-box'> <p class='text-paragraph'>Socrates repeatedly disavowed his own knowledge.

He believed people could arrive at the truth through persistent questioning.</p> </div> <h3 class='content-h3-decorated'>The Socratic Method</h3> <p class='text-paragraph'>Socrates is regarded as one of the greatest teachers of all time. His method involves a teacher asking leading questions to guide students toward discovery. He devoted himself to free-wheeling discussions with young citizens, questioning their confidence in popular opinions without always offering a clear alternative teaching.</p> <h2 class='content-h2'>3.1 Gorgias by Plato</h2> <p class='text-paragraph'>In Plato's writings, Socrates declared that his aim in life was to learn rather than to transmit knowledge. While some contemporaries viewed him as a sophist, he differed from them in several key ways:</p> <ul class='list-standard'> <li class='list-item'><strong>No Lessons:</strong> He did not have pupils in the traditional sense because he claimed to know nothing and thus transmitted nothing.</li> <li class='list-item'><strong>No Salary:</strong> He never asked for payment when talking to young people.</li> <li class='list-item'><strong>Adversarial Relationship:</strong> He constantly criticized the sophists during direct dialogue exchanges.</li> <li class='list-item'><strong>Role Inversion:</strong> He wanted to learn more than to teach, often becoming the 'pupil of his pupils.'</li> </ul> <h2 class='content-h2'>3.2 Analysis: Maieutics and the Search for Truth</h2> <p class='text-paragraph'>Socrates was a man of dialogue who talked to everyone—nobles, soldiers, and ordinary citizens. His method, <span class='text-highlight'>maieutics</span>, is the art of dialogue. It consists of letting others express their ideas and then asking questions about the definitions of the notions they use.</p> <p class='text-paragraph'>Socrates was the first to understand the necessity of <span class='text-highlight'>defining words</span> to arrive at an agreement; he is the inventor of definition. He led people to think for themselves rather than repeating traditional beliefs or prejudices.

Discussion, to Socrates, was not just a tool; it was the means by which education is produced and the objective itself, leading to 'discursive competence'—the ability to understand and express oneself through logical arguments.</p> <h2 class='content-h2'>3.3 Difference between the Sophists and Socrates</h2> <div class='data-table-wrapper'> <table class='data-table'> <thead> <tr> <th>Feature</th> <th>The Sophists</th> <th>Socrates</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td><strong>Goal</strong></td> <td>Knowing how to speak and argue.</td> <td>Developing logical arguments to convince via truth.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Payment</strong></td> <td>Charged money for services.</td> <td>Taught for free.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Method</strong></td> <td>Imposed points of view (what to think).</td> <td>Guided the discovery of truth (how to think).</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Philosophy</strong></td> <td>Persuasion over knowledge.</td> <td>Knowledge = Virtue = Happiness.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Role</strong></td> <td>Hired by the wealthy to win arguments.</td> <td>Sought understanding as the key to happiness.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div class='callout-box'> <span class='callout-quote'>'The Greek philosophers did not develop a child pedagogy, as real education started only when a person was mature enough to talk and think autonomously.'</span> </div> <p class='text-paragraph'>While Sophists used well-formed words to persuade people regardless of the material's truth, Socrates refused to argue points he did not believe in.

He asks if rhetoric teaches the sick how to get well, to which Gorgias replies no. Socrates then points out that in the assembly, when electing a physician, shipwright, or general, the experts in those crafts—not the rhetorician—are consulted. He poses the ultimate question: 'What is the use of coming to you, Gorgias? About what will you teach us to advise the state?--about the just and unjust only, or about those other things also which Socrates has just mentioned?' How will you answer them?</p> <h2 class='content-h2'>3.5 Analysis of the Extract</h2> <p class='text-paragraph'>Socrates was a man of dialogue. He liked to talk to young people particularly, but also to great sophist teachers, nobles, soldiers, ordinary citizens; in short, to everyone. He was interested in what people thought they knew, in their certainties, beliefs, ideas, knowledge. His method was called <span class='text-highlight'>maieutics</span>, which is an art of dialogue. It consisted of discussing with others, letting them express their own ideas and asking them questions about the meaning and definition of the notions they use.</p> <p class='text-paragraph'>Socrates was the first to understanding the necessity of defining the words people used in order to arrive at an agreement. He is the inventor of definition. Thus he obliged people to think by themselves, rather than to repeat ready-made ideas, prejudices and traditional beliefs. The aim of maieutics is therefore to lead people to use their minds and to discover Truth by themselves. Socrates emphasized the search for Truth rather than the accumulation of knowledge.</p> <p class='text-paragraph'>The contribution of Socrates to the history of education consists of fostering the idea that education is not a process of transmitting or imposing a content or a norm. It is rather a process of training within which the learner is required to assume his own thoughts, his convictions and life orientations by using his mind. According to Socratic philosophy, education is related to the idea of discussions without violence during which the participants expose their respective points of view by using arguments that are susceptible of persuading the participants. For Socrates, discussion is not only a means of education. It is at the same time the means by which education is produced and the objective of training, which is equivalent to the acquisition of a 'discursive competence'.</p> <div class='data-table-wrapper'> <table class='data-table'> <thead> <tr> <th>Educated Person</th> <th>Core Philosophy</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td><strong>For the sophists</strong></td> <td>To know how to speak, how to argue.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>For Socrates</strong></td> <td>To know how to develop logical argumentations to convince others' of one's point of view.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <p class='text-paragraph'>Therefore, the Greek philosophers did not really develop a child pedagogy, since for them real education started only when a person is mature enough to talk and to think autonomously.</p> </div> </div>"

Plato</h2> <p class='text-paragraph'>He was Socrates' disciple. Socrates was condemned to suicide for political reasons, an event that represented for Plato the failure of Socratic method and education. Plato believed it was necessary to go beyond discussion and propose a more powerful education capable of deeply transforming men, rather than just their discourse.</p> <p class='text-paragraph'>For Plato, true education is a substitute for policy. In a political situation dominated by violence, he considered education a means to re-make human society. As an <span class='text-highlight'>utopist</span>, his aim was to completely re-make man by shaping him from childhood. He proposed a pedagogy based on a long learning process through different degrees of knowledge, stretching from adolescence to adulthood.</p> <h3 class='content-h3-decorated'>Meritocracy and Social Structure</h3> <p class='text-paragraph'>His education followed a meritocratic ideology where all adolescents—rich or poor, boys or girls—underwent the same training. Gradually, children would be distinguished by their natural merits into three social components:</p> <ul class='list-standard'> <li class='list-item'><strong>Workers and Peasants:</strong> Those who provide the material needs of society.</li> <li class='list-item'><strong>Guards (Soldiers):</strong> Those who protect the community.</li> <li class='list-item'><strong>Philosophers:</strong> The minority who lead based on their grasp of truth.</li> </ul> <h2 class='content-h2'>4.1 Plato's Academy</h2> <p class='text-paragraph'>In 387 B.C., Plato founded the Academy in a garden near Athens. While it began as a simple gathering place for students, it eventually grew into the first 'think tank' or university.

Aristotle (384 BC—322 BC)</h2> <p class='text-paragraph'>Aristotle is a towering figure in ancient Greek philosophy who made important contributions to logic, rhetoric, biology, mathematics, and politics. A student of Plato for twenty years, he became famous for rejecting Plato’s theory of forms, favoring a more <span class='text-highlight'>empirically minded</span> approach based on observation.</p> <p class='text-paragraph'>As the father of Western logic, Aristotle developed the first formal system for reasoning. He discovered that the validity of an argument is determined by its structure rather than its content. This is best seen in the <strong>syllogism</strong>:</p> <div class='callout-box'> <p class='text-paragraph'>1. All men are mortal (Premise)<br/>2. Socrates is a man (Premise)<br/>3. Therefore, Socrates is mortal (Conclusion)</p> </div> <h3 class='content-h3-decorated'>Natural Philosophy and Metaphysics</h3> <p class='text-paragraph'>In his natural philosophy, Aristotle combined logic with observation. In biology, he used the concept of species to make empirical claims. In psychology, he viewed the body as matter and the <span class='text-highlight'>psyche as the form</span> of each living animal. In his ethics, he held that excellence is the only path to <strong>eudaimonia</strong>—a state of happiness that constitutes the best kind of human life.</p> <h2 class='content-h2'>5.1 The Academy Years</h2> <p class='text-paragraph'>Aristotle joined Plato's Academy at age 17 and remained for 20 years. While his early works like <em>Eudemus</em> show a strong Platonic influence, he eventually distanced himself from Plato’s theory of Forms. Plato argued that a suprasensible realm of Forms makes particular things intelligible (e.g., a horse is a horse because it imitates the Form of 'Horse').</p> <p class='text-paragraph'>Aristotle countered this in <em>Metaphysics</em>, arguing that immutable Forms cannot explain how particulars come into existence or change. To him, the theory simply introduced new entities without solving the problems of the physical world.</p> <h2 class='content-h2'>5.2 The Lyceum</h2> <p class='text-paragraph'>At age 50, Aristotle established his own school, the <span class='text-highlight'>Lyceum</span>. His followers were known as <strong>peripatetics</strong> because they walked (peripatos) during their discussions.

However, the educational thinking of the Sophists and philosophers was never confronted with the concrete problem of educating children in a classroom. They did not have an educational system, a school, or child pedagogy as we know them today.</p> <p class='text-paragraph'>Instead, their thinking was oriented toward the <span class='text-highlight'>foundations of education</span>—designed for already shaped men to be transformed through words, discussion, and persuasion.
